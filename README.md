# SpaceBattle Game

Open the SpaceBattle folder.  Right click on `src/resources`, `Mark Directory As`, `Resources Root`.

This should now run here:
```
src/main/java/exectution/LoadAndRun.java
```

And be configurable here:
```
src/resources/config.properties
```

## Default Heuristic
- dist - distance between ships
- dot - are they facing same direction
- distPoints - distance scaled	
- firePoints - amount of times opponent has been hit
